      content: "I want to write about Mohammad in this recommendation letter, but if two persons (like me and Mohammad) familiar with each other for a long time and also different collaboration, it can be a difficult job to write in this circumstance. I can say that I've known him when he starts his bachelor's degree. In a nutshell, Mohammad is awfully great! but WHY. He is an intelligent, enthusiastic, creative person and also a real friend for me. He has lots of big dreams and ideas and I hope he can reach all of them. If I want to say more about our collaborations, I should list co-working in writing a paper and founding a start-up about AI. He is very interested in AI and I know that changing his direction to a new field has excellent reasons. I've best wishes to him.",
